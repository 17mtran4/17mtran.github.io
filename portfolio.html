        <div class="description"><p>Fish Story was designed to be the first game Khoi and I would make together. The purpose of the game was for us to get into the gist of how Scratch worked and create a solid game people could play. The player fish had to collect balls to achieve a high score. If the fish touches a deadly hook, the game is over; the fish sends a "death" broadcast that will change the backdrop to a game over screen and freeze the fish. Every time the fish touched the balls, however, the ball would disappear, the fish would get bigger, and the score would increase by one.</p></div>

        <div class="description"><p>The purpose of the game was to explore the usage of sprites in a Scratch environment, and create a MMORPG-like experience. For the animation process, Khoi and I created frames using sprites off of MapleStory and had the costume change every .15 seconds. For the difficulty system, however, we decreased the time it took for the boss' attack to occur when it hit certain intervals.</p></div>
